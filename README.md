## Mobile-friendly version of the "Text Terminal HOWTO"

This is more mobile-friendly version of David S. Lawyer's "Text Terminal HOWTO".

The original HTML source is at http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/html_single/Text-Terminal-HOWTO/ .

Changes to the source:
- Added a &lt;meta name="viewport"&gt; tag to the HTML file
- Added a stylesheet and &lt;link&gt;'ed it to HTML file.
- Added a some CSS to the new stylesheet to make the docs more legible on mobile
